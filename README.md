# Black-Scholes Call & Put Heatmap Generator

## Overview
This Python program calculates Call and Put option prices using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model and visualizes them in heatmap form over a range of spot prices and volatilities.  
The program features an interactive GUI built with `tkinter`, allowing the user to input parameters, set ranges, and view results instantly.

## Black-Scholes Formula

The Black-Scholes-Merton model prices European-style options under certain assumptions (log-normal asset price distribution, constant volatility, and no dividends).  

For a Call option price \( C \):

\[
C = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
\]

For a Put option price \( P \):

\[
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S N(-d_1)
\]

Where:
\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}
\]
\[
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
\]

**Variables:**
- \( S \) = Spot price of the underlying asset
- \( K \) = Strike price
- \( T \) = Time to maturity (in years)
- \( r \) = Risk-free interest rate (annual)
- \( \sigma \) = Volatility of the underlying asset (annualized)
- \( N(x) \) = Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution

## How the Program Uses the Formula
- The functions `call_bsm_calc` and `put_bsm_calc` implement the above formulas to compute Call and Put prices respectively.
- Inputs are taken from the GUI fields for:
  - Spot Price (S)
  - Strike Price (K)
  - Time to Maturity (T)
  - Risk-Free Rate (r)
  - Volatility (Ïƒ)
- The calculated option prices are rounded to two decimal places for display.

---

## Heatmap Functionality
- The program generates two heatmaps: one for Call prices and one for Put prices.
- Axes:
  - **X-axis:** Spot Price values within a user-defined range.
  - **Y-axis:** Volatility values within a user-defined range.
- Each cell in the heatmap represents the option price for that combination of Spot Price and Volatility, calculated using the Black-Scholes formula.
- Color intensity corresponds to the magnitude of the option price, providing a clear visual representation of how prices change across the parameter space.

## Features
- Call and Put price calculation using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
- Interactive GUI with input fields and sliders for parameter ranges.
- Side-by-side heatmaps for Call and Put prices.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Adjustable spot price and volatility ranges.
